AdventOfCode
============

This repo contains solutions to Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com) for the year 2015

Haven't done advent of code? You should atleast attempt solutions before digging through these solutions. It is a fun programming experience.

This code is mainly php because PHP is my go-to language for writing things. I may add solutions in golang or python as well. I may also go back and refactor solutions, add additional languages for days, etc. All with the goal of allowing for someone to learn from these solutions.

Have comments? open issues.
